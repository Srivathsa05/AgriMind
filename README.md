## ✨ Key Features

- **Personalized Crop Recommendations**: Suggests the most suitable crops based on multi-factor analysis of soil, weather, and market data.
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Fetches live data for soil properties, localized weather forecasts, and current market trends.
- **Yield and Profit Forecasting**: Provides farmers with estimated yield, profit margins, and a sustainability score for each recommendation.
- **Pest and Disease Detection**: Helps identify common crop diseases and pests, suggesting appropriate remedies.
- **Interactive & Accessible UI**: A simple, intuitive web interface designed for users with varying levels of technical literacy.
- **Sustainable Farming**: Promotes long-term soil health by considering past crop rotation data.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  **Data Input**: The farmer provides their location via the web interface.
2.  **Data Aggregation**: The system automatically pulls relevant data from multiple external APIs for soil, weather, and market prices.
3.  **AI/ML Core Processing**: The aggregated data is fed into our core machine learning model for analysis.
4.  **Analysis & Prediction**: The model analyzes the inputs to determine the most suitable crops, predict their yield, and calculate potential profits.
5.  **Recommendation Delivery**: The final recommendations are presented to the farmer on a clean, easy-to-understand dashboard.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: SQLite / PostgreSQL
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
