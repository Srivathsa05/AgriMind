## üìñ Background

Farmers often face challenges in accessing timely, personalized, and accurate agricultural support. Obstacles like language barriers, lack of specific technical knowledge, and the limited reach of conventional advisory services reduce the effectiveness of existing solutions.

This project leverages emerging generative AI technologies to bridge that gap. AgroAdvisor AI delivers a hyper-localized guidance system in natural language, helping farmers make data-driven decisions to improve their livelihoods.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Personalized Crop Recommendations**: Suggests the most suitable crops based on a multi-factor analysis.
- **Real-time Data Integration**:
    - **Soil Properties**: Fetches real-time soil data (pH, moisture, nutrient content) using APIs from sources like **Soil Grids** and **Bhuvan**.
    - **Weather Forecasts**: Integrates localized weather predictions to assess crop viability.
    - **Market Trends**: Analyzes current market demand and price trends by scraping or using agri-market APIs.
- **Yield and Profit Forecasting**: Provides farmers with estimated yield, profit margins, and a sustainability score for each recommended crop.
- **Interactive & Accessible UI**: A simple, intuitive web interface designed for users with varying levels of technical literacy.
- **Multilingual Support**: Features voice and chat interfaces in local languages, allowing farmers to ask questions naturally and receive actionable advice.
- **Sustainable Farming**: Promotes long-term soil health by considering past crop rotation data in its recommendations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The system follows a simple yet powerful data-to-decision pipeline:

1.  **Data Input**: The farmer provides their location via the web interface.
2.  **Data Aggregation**: The system automatically pulls relevant data from multiple external sources:
    - Soil data from geospatial APIs.
    - Weather forecasts from meteorological APIs.
    - Market prices from agricultural market portals.
3.  **AI/ML Core Processing**: The aggregated data, along with the farm's crop rotation history, is fed into our core machine learning model.
4.  **Analysis & Prediction**: The model analyzes the inputs to determine the most suitable crops, predict their yield, and calculate potential profits.
5.  **Recommendation Delivery**: The final recommendations are presented to the farmer on a clean, easy-to-understand dashboard on the website.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   Node.js and npm (if you have a separate frontend framework)
-   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install required Python packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup (if applicable):**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the frontend directory
    cd frontend

    # Install npm packages
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. Add your API keys and other configuration variables here.
    ```
    # .env example
    SOIL_API_KEY=your_soil_api_key
    WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    -   **Start the backend server:**
        ```sh
        # From the backend directory
        python app.py
        ```
    -   **Start the frontend development server:**
        ```sh
        # From the frontend directory
        npm start
        ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to the local server address.

-   Enter a location to get started.
-   The dashboard will display real-time data for the specified area.
-   View the list of recommended crops along with their predicted yield, profit, and sustainability scores.
-   Use the chat interface to ask specific questions in your preferred language.
